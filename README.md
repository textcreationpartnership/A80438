#A remonstrance of the sincere and zealous protestation of Abiezer Coppe, against the blasphemous and execrable opinions recited in the act of Aug. 10. 1650. The breach whereof, the author hath (through mistake) been mis-suspected of, when he hath not been in the least guilty thereof, &c. Or, innocence (clouded with the name of transgression) wrapt up in silence; but now (a little) peeping forth from under the thick and black clouds of obloquie, arising out of the sea of malice in some, and out of weakness, ignorance, and mistake in others; who are by the author much pitied, and dearly beloved. And for their sakes primely, as also for the satisfaction of many, and information of all, this ensuing remonstrance, vindication, and attestation is published, per me, Abiezer Coppe,-de Newgate. Which is as a preamble to a farther future declaration of what he hath been, and now is; who hath been so cloathed with a cloud, that few have known him.#
